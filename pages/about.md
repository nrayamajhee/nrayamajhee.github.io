{{ site.description }}

Hello! I am Nishan Rayamajhee.
I love to design and [hack](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/hacker.html) things when I am not slacking or hanging out at some lousy party.
I am from Nepal and I went to school at [University of New Orleans](http://www.uno.edu).

Here's my [resume]({{ site.url }}/resume). If you're looking for a passionate rustacean with zero professional experience in it, please consider hiring me!

Play my homework: [Moordenaar]({{ site.url }}/Moordenaar/).
