{{ site.description }}

Hello! I am Nishan Rayamajhee.
I love to design and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/hacker.html" onclick="location.href='https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html';" target="_blank">hack</a> things when I am not slacking or hanging out at some lousy party.
I am from Nepal and I went to school here at [University of New Orleans](http://www.uno.edu).

Here's my [resume](/files/Resume.pdf). If you're looking for a passionate rustacean with zero professional experience in it, please consider hiring me!
