## Moksha

This is an experimental video game written in rust. Building an editor of some sorts is the first priority; the actual game will follow. Keep note that this can be used as a library but is not intended as such since the code quality and feature set has a long way to go before being library worthy.

The project and the source code is available here:

- Live Demo: <https://moksha.rayamajhee.com/>
- Staging: <https://nrayamajhee.gitlab.io/moksha/>
- Source: <https://gitlab.com/nrayamajhee/moksha>

## Dotfiles

This repository is full of my personal configuration for vim, tmx, and alacrrity as I use them as my development environment.

## Json Visualizer

This is a very simple json viewer for viewing a large set of json data in tabular form.
Please note that this will only work if the incoming json values is an array of objects.
